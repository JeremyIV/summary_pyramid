# Top 10 Gayest Quotes from Moby-Dick, Ranked by Gayness

Based on the summary provided, here are the top 10 quotes from Moby-Dick that could be interpreted as having homoerotic subtext, ranked in order of their suggested "gayness":

1. **"Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost thought I had been his wife."**
   *This takes the top spot for explicitly comparing their physical intimacy to a marital relationship, with Ishmael casting himself in the feminine role.*

2. **"...sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain."**
   *This quote directly evokes marriage vows with its "till death do us part" sentiment, suggesting a profound intimacy beyond friendship.*

3. **"At length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow-male in that matrimonial sort of style..."**
   *Ishmael directly acknowledges the romantic/sexual implications of their physical closeness while simultaneously drawing attention to it.*

4. **"Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance... take my body who will, take it I say, it is not me."**
   *This philosophical surrender has strong connotations of bodily offering that, in context of his relationship with Queequeg, takes on suggestive overtones.*

5. **"I sat down on the side of the bed... I got up and took off my monkey-jacket... I then took off my coat, and thought a little more in my shirt-sleeves... I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots."**
   *This prolonged undressing scene before getting into bed with Queequeg creates an atmosphere of intimate revelation.*

6. **"You gettee in," he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and throwing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way."**
   *Queequeg's invitation to share his bed, combined with Ishmael's emphasis on interpreting the gesture positively, marks a turning point in their relationship.*

7. **Ishmael's description of Bulkington with his "noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam" with "such brawn," "deeply brown and burnt" face, "dazzling" white teeth, and "the deep shadows of his eyes."**
   *This lingering, admiring physical description focuses on traditionally masculine attributes in a sensuous way.*

8. **"No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother... And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger... then your objections indefinitely multiply."**
   *Ishmael's extended meditation on why men shouldn't want to share beds, just before he does exactly that, reveals both anxiety and fascination with male physical intimacy.*

9. **Father Mapple "with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes" climbing to the pulpit "with a truly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand."**
   *The sensuous, detailed description of physical movement combined with suggestive imagery creates subtle homoerotic undertones.*

10. **"All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth" and "after sore wrestlings in his berth, Jonah's prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep."**
    *The physical discomfort described in sensuous language with terms like "sore wrestlings" creates potentially suggestive imagery.*

These quotes reflect the intense homosocial world of 19th-century whaling where men lived in extremely close quarters. While modern interpretations might read these as homoerotic, they also represent period-typical male bonding and the novel's exploration of intimate human connections across cultural boundaries.
